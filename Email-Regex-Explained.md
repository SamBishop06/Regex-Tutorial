# Title 
Regex Tutorial: Understanding and Explaining the Regular Expression for Matching Emails

Have you ever wondered how systems validate email addresses? They use regular expressions for this, which are essentially search patterns. In this guide, we will break down the email regex, specifically designed to recognize email addresses. This guide will walk you through each part of the email regex, explaining how it works and how to identify different types of emails.



## Summary
In this tutorial, we'll explore the elements of an email address and how regular expressions are utilized to validate them. We'll discuss Anchors, Quantifiers, OR Operator, Character Classes, Flags, Grouping and Capturing, Bracket Expressions, Greedy and Lazy Matching, Boundaries, Back-references, and Look-ahead/Look-behind assertions.

## Regex Components
The email regex is composed of the following components:
/^([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,})(\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})?$/


### Anchors
Anchors mark the beginning (`^`) and end (`$`) of a regex's search within a string. In the context of email validation, these anchors ensure that the entire string is considered for a match against the defined email pattern. Without anchors, the regex might match only a portion of the email, leading to incorrect validation.


### Quantifiers
Quantifiers determine how many times a character or a group of characters can appear in the input string. In the provided email regex, various quantifiers such as +, *, and `{2,}` are used to specify the structure of an email address. For example, + indicates that the preceding character or group must appear one or more times, ensuring that the local part and domain part of the email address contain at least one character.


### OR Operator
The OR operator (|) allows for multiple alternatives within a regex. In the email regex provided, it's not explicitly used, but implied by the structure of the pattern. For instance, the regex ([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+) matches the local part of the email address, where different characters are allowed within the specified range.``



### Character Classes
Character classes, also known as bracket expressions, define which characters are allowed in specific parts of an email address. In the email regex provided, character classes are used to validate the local part and domain part of the email address. For example, [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-] allows alphanumeric characters, periods, underscores, percentage signs, plus signs, and hyphens in the local part of the email address.


### Flags
When using regular expressions to match email addresses, flags can be useful for refining the matching process. While not all regex engines support flags, those that do offer options to adjust how the pattern matches against the input. Here are some flags commonly used when matching emails:

i (ignore case): This flag allows the regex pattern to match email addresses regardless of case sensitivity. For example, it enables matching "example@example.com" as well as "Example@Example.com".
g (global): Although not typically used for email validation, the global flag can be useful if searching for multiple email addresses within a larger text or document. It ensures that all valid email addresses are captured, rather than stopping at the first match.
m (multiline): Email addresses are often found within multiline text, such as in email headers or message bodies. The multiline flag enables the regex pattern to correctly identify email addresses across multiple lines by modifying the behavior of the ^ and $ anchors to match the start and end of each line.
Flags can enhance the flexibility and accuracy of email matching using regular expressions, especially in scenarios where case sensitivity or multiline text is a consideration.


### Grouping and Capturing
Grouping and capturing isolate and extract specific parts of the email address. In the provided email regex, four groups are used to capture the local part, domain name, and top-level domain (TLD). These groups allow for easy extraction of individual components of the email address for further processing or validation.



### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions, also known as character classes, play a crucial role in email matching using regular expressions. They define which characters are allowed in specific parts of an email address. When validating email addresses, bracket expressions are used to ensure that the local part, domain part, and top-level domain (TLD) adhere to the expected format. Here's how bracket expressions are utilized:

[a-zA-Z0-9]: This character class allows alphanumeric characters in the local part of the email address. It ensures that both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers, are accepted.
[.-]: Hyphens and periods are commonly permitted in the local part and domain part of email addresses. This expression allows for the inclusion of these characters where appropriate.
[a-zA-Z]: When validating the domain part of an email address, only alphabetic characters are allowed in the TLD. This expression ensures that the TLD consists of letters only, without any numbers or special characters.


### Greedy and Lazy Match
Greedy and lazy matching refer to how quantifiers behave when matching patterns in the input string. Greedy quantifiers attempt to match as many characters as possible, while lazy quantifiers match as few characters as possible. In the context of email validation, greedy quantifiers are typically used to ensure that the entire email address is matched correctly.


### Boundaries
Boundaries specify where a pattern can match in the input string. In the context of email validation, boundaries ensure that the regex pattern matches the email address as a standalone entity and does not inadvertently match parts of other text. The following boundaries are commonly used:

^ (caret): The caret symbol marks the start of a string. In the provided email regex (`/^([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,})(\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})?$/`), the caret indicates that the pattern must match from the beginning of the string, ensuring that the email address is not preceded by any other characters.
`$(dollar sign)`: The dollar sign marks the end of a string. In the provided email regex, the dollar sign ensures that the pattern must match until the end of the string, preventing partial matches. This ensures that the entire email address is considered for validation and that no additional characters follow the email address.
By anchoring the regex pattern with the caret and dollar sign, boundaries ensure that the pattern matches complete email addresses and avoids partial matches or matches within other text. This ensures accurate validation of email addresses within a larger body of text.


### Back-references
Back-references allow you to refer back to previously matched groups within a regex pattern. In the context of email validation, back-references can be used to ensure that certain parts of the email address match each other, such as ensuring that the opening and closing brackets of an email address are the same.

For example, in the provided email regex (/^([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,})(\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})?$/), each captured group (enclosed in parentheses) can be referenced by a back-reference.

Here's how back-references work:

\1, \2, \3, ...: These back-references refer to the contents of the first, second, third, and so on, captured group within the regex pattern. For example, \1 refers to the contents of the first captured group, \2 refers to the contents of the second captured group, and so on.
In the provided email regex, back-references can be used to ensure that the domain name and the top-level domain (TLD) match each other. For example, ([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+) captures the domain name, and \4 can be used to ensure that the TLD matches the domain name.

Here's an example of how back-references can be used in email validation:

regex
Copy code
/^([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,})(\.\4)?$/ 
In this modified regex pattern, \4 is used as a back-reference to ensure that the optional second TLD (if present) matches the first TLD captured by the regex.

By using back-references, you can ensure consistency and coherence within the components of an email address, leading to more accurate validation and matching.
